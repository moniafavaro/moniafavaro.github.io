                  Hi, I'm Monia, a Junior Software Engineer based in London.
                  Having previously worked in the retail industry for 3 years,
                  where I learned to be a valuable team member and solve
                  problems under pressure, I felt confident and ready for a
                  career change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the first lookdown started I founded time to learn a new
                  skill. I’ve chosen to start a self-learning journey with
                  Python, using books and online resources, but unfortunately
                  I’ve felt that I needed something different to help me
                  progressing in this area, so I enrolled in a Software
                  Engineering Immersive Course with General Assembly, and I’ve
                  fallen in love with it. Coding is now my new passion, where I
                  can be creative, curious and I'm constantly learning new
                  skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am now looking for my first job as a Junior Software
                  Engineer in a friendly environment where I can advance and
                  expand my skill set through targeted mentorship and
                  challenging projects.
                </p>
